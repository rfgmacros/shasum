Shasum values for Keyboard Maestro macros

I share a number of [Keyboard Maestro](https://keyboardmaestro.com) macros on my personal blog and on the Keyboard Maestro forums. Those macros typically include an updater that can download an updated copy of the macro from within the macro. This Github site is used to verify those downloads, by storing shasum values for each macro.
